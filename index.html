        <h3 class="webdev">Web Development | Level 1 = Beginner</h3>
        <p>For the past few weeks, I have been following a Web Development Bootcamp on Udemy by Dr. Angela Yu where I have been learning about HTML and CSS fundamentals and I will soon be learning about Javascript, Node, React, and more. It is thanks to this course that I have been able to build this website! <br><br>During my free time and when I am commuting, I spend some time on the iOS App Mimo to review my Web Development learnings, discover the Python language and review what I have learned in class on the SQL language. </p>

        <h3 class="mark">Marketing </h3>
<p>Through my program, I had the opportunity to complete a group project in each of my Marketing classes. This allowed me
  to analyse and understand the different Marketing strategies that exist while sometimes applying them to real-world scenarios.
  As part of my program at Concordia University, I followed 9 different Marketing classes that can be found <a href="https://www.concordia.ca/jmsb/programs/undergraduate/bachelor/majors/marketing/courses.html">here</a>.
<br><br>
  Sales is also part of Marketing, and I believe my experience as a Sales Associate at The North Face is relevant because I was building brand and product awareness whilte turning it into profit.

      <h3 class="sysanal">Business Systems Analysis</h3>
<p>This is where most of my Business Technology Management classes fit. I have acquired the skills to be able to take into consideration user requirements while evaluating the problems and opportunities for improvement of an IS. I am also able
  to determine the best IT products and services that a company can use in order to solve business problems.<br><br>
  While completing this second major, I collaboratively wrote extensive reports on Information Systems Analysis, Design & Implementation but also on Information Technology Strategy, Management, & Sourcing. </p>    </div>
